# mumate

mumate is an extension of the research I did to satisfy my undergraduate degree requirements: numerical simulations of MnSi thin films (Dalhousie University)

Included are a .mx3 source file to run the numerical simulation of a helicoid in an MnSi thin film using the MuMax3 simulator written by https://github.com/barnex.
All material constants were acquired from a previous student and confirmed with my supervisor (Dr. Monchesky, Dalhousie University)

The main purpose of this repo will be to implement the tools I built to interpret the data and hopefully package them as general purpose python modules.

Note: I will be updating this repo at my own pace to try and make it more user friendly / less cowboy coded.
