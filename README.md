# Helicoid-Simulations
MuMax3 Micromagnetic Simulation Software project: Helicoid in MnSi thin films (Dalhousie University)

This is the MuMax3 (a subset of Go) code to run the numerical simulation of a helicoid in an MnSi thin film.
The governing dynamical differential equation is the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, discretised using a finite difference method.
For finding the lowest energy state, a conjugate gradient descent method is used to minimise a free energy functional.
All material constants were acquired from a previous student and confirmed with my supervisor (Dr. Monchesky, Dalhousie University)
